### Statement

A basic, classic piano with white and black keys. This program will be controlled, using/clicking the mouse. 

### Results 

This program was written using p5.js and its sound library (p5.sound). Eariler in theprocess, I was recommended to try to use the keyboard functions as the piano keys rather than pressing with the mouse; I was unable to meet this goal, so the piano will be played with the mouse. Lastly, in my original proposal, the piano was supposed to be vertical instead of horizontal. I had gone through many trials trying to reposition parts of the code and had no luck. As a result, the piano is in a horizontal position. Overall, my piano runs fine. Each key has their own individual note and color when they are pressed with a mouse. When testing the piano, I noticed that some keys would need multiple clicks for the note to play. I looked over the code and found no problem; perhaps the local editor I used is a bit glitchy. 

### Objectives Achieved
* Working both locally and p5.js
* Figured out the ps.sound library
* Keys work/notes play when they are pressed with the mouse
* Formation of white and black keys
* Individual color changes when each key is pressed with mouse

## Built With

* [p5.js](https://editor.p5js.org/) - The web editor used
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - Locally 

## Credits

* [monniqian](https://editor.p5js.org/monniqian/sketches/TwckaaeGl) - creator on p5.js that gave me inspiration for this program
